## Electrical Distribution Network Energy Consumption Forecasting based upon Victorian MRIM Meter Data

### Background
Energy consumption forecasting plays a vital role in planning, operations and management of modern power systems. If the supply exceeds the demand, the energy can be stored. However, the surplus energy cannot be stored in a large capacity, has a limited storage lifespan, requires high maintenance and hence, the storage is costly. If the supply power goes below the demand, this would lead to overloading the supply line and causing potential blackouts.

### Objective
Providing reliable forecasting of energy consumption results in a better management of the electrical distribution network. The objective of this Project is therefore to forecast energy consumption for an electrical distribution network based on Victorian MRIM meter data. The forecast will be built upon machine learning models that is utilised in time series problems. In addition, the energy consumption will be forecasted based purely from historical data.
The energy consumption will be forecasted based on historical data that are obtained directly via MRIM meters from an electrical distribution network. The rationale behind this is to alleviate the dependence of other parameters, such as the weather, which are in itself also forecasts. If the weather or such similar parameters are forecasted incorrectly, it will directly impact the accuracy of the energy consumption forecast.
