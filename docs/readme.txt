This report documents the design and testing of machine learning models to forecast energy consumption for an electrical distribution network based on 
Victorian MRIM meter data. In addition, the report discusses where the data is acquired and the analysis of the data to ensure the dataâ€™s viability as 
input for the machine learning models.

The performance of each model was compared with actual values based on visualisation and two performance metrics i.e. R2 Score and Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error (MAPE). The project has resulted in a satisfactory outcome where it provided recommendations on the most appropriate model for 
forecasting energy consumption for an electrical distribution network.

The report also documents additional work to explore further to this project. This includes the possible pipeline that can be used to forecast energy consumption for other electrical distribution networks. Besides energy consumption, this pipeline can assist in forecasting consumption of resources 
to generate energy.
